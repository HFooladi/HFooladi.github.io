In this talk, I presented our work on pattern formation during human embryonic stem cell development. 
We proposed a multicellular mathematical model for pattern formation during the in-vitro gastrulation of human ESCs. 
This model enhances the basic principles of the Waddington epigenetic landscape with cell-cell communication, which enables us to describe how the pattern and tissue formation occurs in the course of development.
