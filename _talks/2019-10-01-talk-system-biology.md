In this talk I presented our work on pattern formation during human embryonic stem cells development. 
We propose a multicellular mathematical model for pattern formation during in vitro gastrulation of human ESCs. 
This model enhances the basic principles of Waddington epigenetic landscape with cellâ€“cell communication, in order to enable pattern and tissue formation.
