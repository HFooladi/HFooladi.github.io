### Enhanced Waddington Landscape Model with Cell-Cell Communication Can Explain Molecular Mechanisms of Self-Organization

**Hosein Fooladi**, Parsa Moradi, Ali Sharifi-Zarchi, and Babak Hosein Khalaj

Abstract: Motivation: The molecular mechanisms of self-organization that orchestrate embryonic cells to create
astonishing patterns have been among major questions of developmental biology. It is recently shown that
embryonic stem cells (ESCs), when cultured in particular micropatterns, can self-organize and mimic the
early steps of pre-implantation embryogenesis. A systems-biology model to address this observation from
a dynamical systems perspective is essential and can enhance understanding of the phenomenon.
Results: Here, we propose a multicellular mathematical model for pattern formation during in vitro gastrulation of human ESCs. 
This model enhances the basic principles of Waddington epigenetic landscape with
cell-cell communication, in order to enable pattern and tissue formation. We have shown the sufficiency of
a simple mechanism by using a minimal number of parameters in the model, in order to address a variety
of experimental observations such as the formation of three germ layers and trophectoderm, responses to
altered culture conditions and micropattern diameters, and unexpected spotted forms of the germ layers
under certain conditions. Moreover, we have tested different boundary conditions as well as various shapes, observing that the pattern 
is initiated from the boundary and gradually spreads towards the center.
This model provides a basis for in-silico modeling of self-organization.

### Recognizing Arrow Of Time In The Short Stories

Fahimeh Hosseini, **Hosein Fooladi**, Mohammad Reza Samsami

Abstract: Recognizing arrow of time in short stories is a challenging task. i.e., given only two paragraphs,
determining which comes first and which comes next is a difficult task even for humans. In
this paper, we have collected and curated a novel dataset for tackling this challenging task. We
have shown that a pre-trained BERT architecture achieves reasonable accuracy on the task, and
outperforms RNN-based architectures.

### Optimum Design, Manufacturing and Experiment of a Passive Walking Biped: Effects of Structural Parameters on Efficiency, Stability and Robustness on Uneven Trains

S.M.Hadi Sadati, M. Borgheinejad, **H. Fooladi**, M. Naraghi, and A.R. Ohadi

Abstract: Passive walkers perform a walking like stable limit cycle on small slopes without any external control. 
In this research, a deployed model of biped that can be built has been considered, and then its walking performance sensitivity 
such as efficiency, stability and robustness on uneven trains due to variation of structural parameters and their optimum limits 
have been investigated. It was shown that the foot arc radius and center of mass height have the most important effect on 
walking performance. After doing simulations in MSC.ADAMS software, an optimum design trend has been suggested. 
At the end based on experimental results, it was shown beside optimization of structural parameters, 
the impact condition is very important to achieve optimal walking.
