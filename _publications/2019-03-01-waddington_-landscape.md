*Abstract*: Motivation: The molecular mechanisms of self-organization that orchestrate embryonic cells to create
astonishing patterns have been among major questions of developmental biology. It is recently shown that
embryonic stem cells (ESCs), when cultured in particular micropatterns, can self-organize and mimic the
early steps of pre-implantation embryogenesis. A systems-biology model to address this observation from
a dynamical systems perspective is essential and can enhance understanding of the phenomenon.
*Results*: Here, we propose a multicellular mathematical model for pattern formation during in vitro gastrulation of human ESCs. 
This model enhances the basic principles of Waddington epigenetic landscape with
cell-cell communication, in order to enable pattern and tissue formation. We have shown the sufficiency of
a simple mechanism by using a minimal number of parameters in the model, in order to address a variety
of experimental observations such as the formation of three germ layers and trophectoderm, responses to
altered culture conditions and micropattern diameters, and unexpected spotted forms of the germ layers
under certain conditions. Moreover, we have tested different boundary conditions as well as various shapes, observing that the pattern 
is initiated from the boundary and gradually spreads towards the center.
This model provides a basis for in-silico modeling of self-organization.
