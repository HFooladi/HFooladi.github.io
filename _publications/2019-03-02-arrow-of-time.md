**Abstract**: Recognizing arrow of time in short stories is a challenging task. i.e., given only two paragraphs,
determining which comes first and which comes next is a difficult task even for humans. In
this paper, we have collected and curated a novel dataset for tackling this challenging task. We
have shown that a pre-trained BERT architecture achieves reasonable accuracy on the task, and
outperforms RNN-based architectures.
