*Abstract*: Passive walkers perform a walking like stable limit cycle on small slopes without any external control. 
In this research, a deployed model of biped that can be built has been considered, and then its walking performance sensitivity 
such as efficiency, stability and robustness on uneven trains due to variation of structural parameters and their optimum limits 
have been investigated. It was shown that the foot arc radius and center of mass height have the most important effect on 
walking performance. After doing simulations in MSC.ADAMS software, an optimum design trend has been suggested. 
At the end based on experimental results, it was shown beside optimization of structural parameters, 
the impact condition is very important to achieve optimal walking.
