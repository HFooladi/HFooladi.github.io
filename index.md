I am **Hosein Fooladi**, Just a human being. The following descriptions are just social statuses that I have gained through my life, which you may or may not be interested in.

I am **Hosein Fooladi**, System Biology and also Machine Learning Researcher, and currently a PhD student at [Comp3D](https://comp3d.univie.ac.at/) lab. I have obtained my MSc in Biomedical Engineering from Sharif University of Technology  and BSc in Mechanical engineering from Amirkabir University of Technology that enabled me to enrich my knowledge in diverse areas such as nonlinear dynamical system analysis, computational and system biology, computational neuroscience, machine learning (including deep learning) for genomics data and biomedical image analysis.

I have been actively involved in different projects including cell fate specification and pattern formation during development 
(in collaboration with Royan Institute, Tehran, Iran), and the application of deep learning in disease modeling and drug discovery 
(in collaboration with the Cambridge Systems Biology Centre, University of Cambridge).

Now, my main research areas are machine learning in drug discovery (generally scientific machine learning) and the intersection 
of artificial intelligence with cognition (vaguely named AGI). Occasionally, I am doing freelancing works. So please feel
free to [contact](mailto:fooladi.hosein@gmail.com) me if you think your project has an intersection with my expertise domain.

## Interests

- Machine learning
- Computational Drug Discovery and Design 
- Philosophy and Psychology
- Physics
 
You can consider me as an explorer, because I have explored a lot of different fields and disciplines. I like authentic and original ideas.

### Non-Academic
