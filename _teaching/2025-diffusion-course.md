## Diffusion Models Course

A comprehensive course on diffusion models, starting from foundational concepts and building up to state-of-the-art techniques. You can find the course on my Github: [Diffusion-Course](https://github.com/HFooladi/blog-notebooks/tree/main/diffusion-course)

## Course Philosophy

This course emphasizes:

- **Implementation-first learning**: Reproduce papers through code
- **Mathematical rigor**: Understand the theory behind the algorithms
- **Progressive complexity**: Build from simple to advanced concepts
- **Modern tools**: Use JAX for automatic differentiation and GPU acceleration
- **Connections**: Explicit links between different frameworks (score-based ↔ diffusion)
- **Visualization**: 2D examples for intuition, then scale to real images
