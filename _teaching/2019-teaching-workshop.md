I am running a machine learning [workshop](https://github.com/HFooladi/ml_workshop), which I present diverse topics; from knowledge distillation and compression to causal inference and invariance.

You can look at [this page](https://github.com/HFooladi/ml_workshop) to learn more about the contents and format.
