### Deep Learning In Drug Discovery
Deep learning algorithms have achieved state of the art performance in a lot of different tasks. 
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) can be used to achieve great performance in image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation tasks. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and its descendants like LSTMs and GRUs are the 
first things that come to mind in order to tackle problems like neural language translation
, speech recognition and even they can be used to generate new texts and music.

The key aspect of deep learning is representation learning; extracting the relevant information in order to achieve graet performance in a particular task. 
But, what is relevant information? it can be defined as an abstarct feature(layer) that has the most useful information in doing a 
particular task (minimizing training loss) and also can be generalized well to reach significant performance on the unseen(test) data. 

One of the areas that deep learning can be very beneficial is healthcare. Biological data and especially gene expression data are noisy and extracting meaningful information is challenging. 
Also, there are a huge amount of high dimensional biological data (genomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, ...) and analyzing and comprehending this data
is a challenging task. In particular, I am very interested in how we can use deep learning concepts in the task of drug discovery.

First, I am going to learn the abstract features (latent space) of this high dimensional noisy data in order to capture the most relevant information and mask irrelevant information for the task of drug properties prediction. Moreover, I am very interested to analyze and manipulate this latent space in
order to understand what features are very important for drug properties prediction (biological pathways, biological process,...).
In addition, I am very curious about applying the generative model for new compound generation. De-novo drug and molecule design 
can be considered as another branch of drug discovery. In this task, the goal is generating new compounds with desired properties 
based on the training database. I think it is possible to use geometric deep learning approach and apply deep learning on graph (compound) directly and generate new molecules.


### Conversational Agent
I am working as a Chief science officer at Shenakht Pajouh. Our mission is to understand intelligence and after that approaching toward developing Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). We are an interdisciplinary team, viewing intelligence from different perspectives of computer science, psychology, philosophy of mind and neuroscience. 

We think language is one of the important aspects of intelligence and developing an agent with the capability of understanding language and managing a realistic conversation in open domain with a human is a big step forward toward AGI. Today, there are lots of research on the developing agent which is able to have the realistic conversation in a closed domain are like restaurant reservation and hotel booking; but they are not able to generalize their knowledge to talk about another topic or domain. 

As a result, we are working in the field of conversational AI and our goal is developing a mental health assistant which can act in the open domain. There are lots of difficulty like understanding context, having consistent personality through conversation, and evaluation of dialogue. Despite this difficulties and challenges, We believe we are able to become one step closer to understanding intelligence.

As a result, conversational AI is another research area the I am interested in. Specifically, the intersection of NLP and RL seems a reasonable approach to achieve this goal.
