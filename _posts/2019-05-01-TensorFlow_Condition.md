### Introduction

Tensorflow is one of the most popular deep learning frameworks and has played a key role in advancing deep learning. 
I am using Tensorflow for more than two years, but I have seen lots of bizarre and unpredictable behavior during using control flow.
Recently (19 April 2019), I watched a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzKXEbpT9Lg&list=PLQY2H8rRoyvzIuB8rZXs7pfyjiSUs8Vza&index=2&t=900s) of 
TensorFlow teamâ€™s own internal training sessions, which was very helpful and make it more clear how control flow ops work. I definitely recommend watching this video.
The video covers tf.cond() and tf.while_loop in details. So, I decided to write this post to elaborate more on how tf.cond() works, and 
provide some examples for illustration. Hopefully, I will cover tf.while_loop in the subsequent post.

**Note:** I am going to cover low-level operations in this post. There are other ops like Functional ops, which is beyond the scope of this blog post.
