I am **Hosein Fooladi**, Just a human being. The following descriptions are just social statuses that I have gained through my life, which you may or may not be interested in.

I am **Hosein Fooladi**, an experienced Data Scientist and Machine Learning researcher specializing in drug discovery, computational biology, and causal learning. I am currently pursuing my PhD in Pharmaceutical Sciences (Cheminformatics) at the University of Vienna, where I work at the [Comp3D](https://comp3d.univie.ac.at/) lab. My thesis focuses on developing machine learning models for domain generalization in the chemical space.
My academic journey began with a BSc in Mechanical Engineering from Amirkabir University of Technology and continued with an MSc in Biomedical Engineering from Sharif University of Technology, where I was awarded as the Best Master's Student. This diverse educational background has enabled me to enrich my knowledge in areas such as nonlinear dynamical system analysis, computational and systems biology, computational neuroscience, and machine learning for genomics data and biomedical image analysis.

#### Research Interests

My research focuses on developing robust machine learning models that can generalize across different domains in the chemical space. I have proven expertise in:

- Drug discovery and computational chemistry
- Out-of-distribution generalization
- Protein degradation and ternary complex prediction
- Deep learning and Bayesian inference
- Cheminformatics, Bioinformatics and molecular modeling

#### Non-Academic

- I love watching anime and reading manga. My favorites animes are Death Note, Attack On Titans and Tokyo Ghoul. I have started writing notes about underlying anime philosophies.
- I like sports a lot. I am a professional Squash and Football player. Moreover, I am a fan of Formula 1.
- In addition, I am enjoying reading philosophical and psychological books. you can refer to [my goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/75993307-hosein-fooladi) to find out more about my favorites topics.
- Moreover, I like playing games. I prefer the games in the style of [Limbo](https://playdead.com/games/limbo/) and [Inside](https://playdead.com/games/inside/)
