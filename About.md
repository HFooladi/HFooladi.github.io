I am **Hosein Fooladi**, System Biology and also Dep Learning Researcher. I recently obtained my MSc in Biomedical engineering from 
Sharif University of Technology (ranked 1 in Iran) and BSc in Mechanical engineering from Amirkabir University of Technology
(top 3 in Iran) that enable me to enrich my knowledge in diverse areas such as nonlinear dynamical system analysis, 
computational and system biology, computational neuroscience,machine learning (including deep learning) for genomics data and biomedical image analysis.  
I have been actively involved in different projects including cell fate specification and pattern formation during development
(in collaboration with Royan Institute, Tehran, Iran) and the application of deep learning in disease modeling and drug discovery
(in collaboration with the Cambridge Systems Biology Centre, University of Cambridge).
